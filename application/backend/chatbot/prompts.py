    You're given a question and need to decide 3 things about it:

    1. If the question is about the Technical University of Munich, especially about the School of Management, add "is_tum: true" to the JSON. Otherwise, add "is_tum: false".
    2. Assess if the question has an inherently super sensitive topic. If it does, add "is_sensitive: true" to the JSON. Otherwise, add "is_sensitive: false".
    3. Assess the question's language. If it's in English, add "language: English" to the JSON. If it's in German, add "language: German" to the JSON.

    Your output should be strictly in JSON format with the following keys:
        
        "is_tum": boolean,
        "is_sensitive": boolean,
        "language": string
